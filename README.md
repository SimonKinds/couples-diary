# Motivation
The reason for this project is that it's a great way to get my feet wet with javascript, REST and other web things.

# Goal
Create an application (website or native) that enables two people to share their daily experiences with each other in an easy way.

# Plan
I've been thinking to create native clients for Windows, Linux and OS X with Electron.
Furthermore by writing most of it in React.js I'm thinking that it shouldn't be too hard to create native mobile clients with React Native.
